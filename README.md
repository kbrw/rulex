Rulex
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbrw/rulex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbrw/rulex)

This application allows to do very simple rule handler using Elixir pattern
matching :

- declare rules as function clause.
- Create a function `apply_rules` which apply recursively your
  function until no more match, ensuring that each function execution
  happened only once.

## Usage ##

See in [in code documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/rulex)
